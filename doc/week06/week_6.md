## Participants Contribution:
* Ju Hong Kim:
    * **[Issue 13]** *Test and Fix Bugs with Bluetooth Sanitization when reading from Trusted Config File* - Accepted other special characters instead of a colon in the Bluetooth Address
    * **[Issue 19]** *Redirect and notify user that it failed to connect to a server* - used to pretend that it is connected with the server when there's no connection
    * **[Issue 21]** *Once user disconnects on the app, redirect user to main page* - previously it was not intuitive what was happening. Once you disconnected, you are still in the same page and there would be no indication that you are disconnected from the server other than that the server no longer receives messages.
    * **[Issue 22]** *Execute Deauthentication server once user logs on*
    * **[Issue 27]** rfcomm-server: Memory Leaks
