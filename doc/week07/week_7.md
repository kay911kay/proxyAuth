    * **Issue #29:** Allow connection to deauthentication server on trusted device only
    * **Issue #32:** Terminate Deauthentication server if the user manually locks their system
  
* Daniel Wang: 
    * Confirmed Ubertooth repeater mode is limited to only range test between 2 Ubertooth Devices
    * Working on implementing bandwidth and latency checks in the PAM module and authentication service  
    * Will work to try and find an appropriate MiTM test in the following week 
   
* Arslan Qamar
    * **Issue #15:** Worked on security protocol ECDH + authentic encryption using AES 256 GCM partially. 
    * Worked on different UberTooth mode including repeater, confirming UberTooth repaater mode is only for range test according to my testing, research and discussion with Daniel
