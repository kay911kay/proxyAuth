## Elliptic-curve Diffieâ€“Hellman (ECDH) + authenticated encrytion using AES-256-GCM

This repo describes how to use the **shared secret** (generated using **ECDH** between two clients - Alice and Bob) to send authenticated encrypted messages between them using **AES-256-GCM**

In this repo we will use only the **crypto** module that is built inside nodejs.
