## Elliptic-curve Diffieâ€“Hellman (ECDH) + authenticated encrytion using AES-256-GCM

This repo describes how to use the **shared secret** (generated using **ECDH** between two clients - Alice and Bob) to send authenticated encrypted messages between them using **AES-256-GCM**

In this repo we will use only the **crypto** module that is built inside nodejs.

### How to use this repo

1. Clone the repo using

```bash
git clone https://github.com/trulymittal/ECDH-AES-256-GCM.git
```

2. Open terminal inside the downloaded project and install the dependencies using:
